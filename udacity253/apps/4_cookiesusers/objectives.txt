# Problem Set 4 - User Registration, Login, Logout      #
#				(Cookies & Users)						#
#														#
# Note- Problem Set 4 has three homework problems.	    #
#       It is easiest to combine all three into one app.#
#                                                       #    
# Goals:                                                #
# - Create a user registration page that allows users   #
#	register to a database, and sets a user_id cookie   #
# - While user_id cookie is still set, every visit to   #
#   welcome pages should still say "Welcome,            #
#   [appropriate_username]!" 						    #
# - A logout url should reset the user_id cookie to ""  #
#   so the welcome page redirects to the signup page    #
# - A login page should allow registered users to login #
#   and have a valid user_id set, so the welcome page   #
#   welcomes them by name.								#
#                                                       #
# Requirements:                                         #
# - User signup page must follow all the validation     #
#   rules the previous 2_usersignup homework required,  #
#   and must also verify the username doesn't exist     #
# - The login form must validate proper username,       #
#   password, and a username/password match.            #
# - The form methods must be POST, not GET.             #
#                                                       #
# Templates rendered:                                   #
# - login.html   	  			                        #
# - signup.html											#
